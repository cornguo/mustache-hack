mustache-hack
=============

A ported version from [Mustache.php](https://github.com/bobthecow/mustache.php) to hhvm-hack.


Why you made it?
----------------
It's not about performance, but a self-practice for learning hack language.

I'm trying to make it work with hack's partial/decl mode,
and eventually hope it can work without problems in strict mode.

All suggestions are welcomed; together we can make progress :)
